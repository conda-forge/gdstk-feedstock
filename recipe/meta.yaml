  description: |
    Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of
    GDSII and OASIS files.  It is also available as a Python module meant to
    be a successor to Gdspy.  Key features for the creation of complex CAD
    layouts are included: boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
    based on clipping algorithm; polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling
    of polygons); efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets.
